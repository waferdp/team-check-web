## Forming or Storming
Your team is one of two things: *Forming* or *Storming*

### Forming
This is the first stage of team development, and is also known as *Dependency and inclusion*  
Focus on letting everyone speak, and respect that some may be reluctant to do so.  
In this stage, the team both assumes that everyone is aligned on the same goal, as well as relies heavily on a strong leader.

### Storming
This is the second stage of team development, and is also known as *Counterdependency and Fight*  
Team members feel secure enough to express themselves and start questioning the status quo.  
As a leader, keep conflicts from becoming person-oriented by keeping them subject-oriented.  
Establishing and aligning on a common goal is important in this stage.
